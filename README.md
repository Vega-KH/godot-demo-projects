# Godot demo projects in CSharp

This branch contains edits from the original to change all code from 
GDScript to CSharp to be used in the new 3.0 version.  This is a work
in progress and projects will be changed as I get around to them.  Feel
free to do conversion and send pull requests.

Each folder containing a `project.godot` file is a demo project meant to
be used with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), the open source
2D and 3D game engine.

Those demos are distributed under the terms of the MIT license, as
described in the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file.
